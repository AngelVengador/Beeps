# 🔊 Beeps & Vibrations, ToneExplorer

**Beeps & Vibrations** is a simple Android app built with Jetpack Compose that lets developers **preview and test the various system tones available via `ToneGenerator`**.

> ✨ This tool was created out of a real need: when trying to choose the right tone for an app, I discovered there was no easy way to preview the available constants from `ToneGenerator`. All I could find was an outdated YouTube video from over 10 years ago. So I built this for myself and others who might face the same challenge.
